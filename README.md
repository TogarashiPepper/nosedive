# Nosedive
Nosedive is a Discord bot for ranking interactions. 
Users can start a poll with `/createpoll` and vote for who they want to see win.
Users who win get increased elo and losers who lose lose their elo.
Users may query their elo (or someone else's) with `/getelo`. 

# But why?
This bot is inspired by the Black Mirror episode of the same name and is not intended to be used seriously, it was just a funny idea some friends and I had on a whim and so I made it.
